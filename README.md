In this example of 2D frame moving only in the 
x-direction, the vertical component of the apparent speed of light (u) will not change, but the horizontal component will be modified due to the velocity of the Earth.

$$
\tan \phi = \frac{{u'y}}{{u'x}} = \frac{{uy}}{{\gamma(ux + v)}}
$$

$$
\gamma = \left(1 - \frac{{v^2}}{{c^2}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}, \quad v \text{ is the velocity of the observer}, \quad c \text{ is the magnitude of the velocity of light.}
$$

$$
(u_x, u_y) \text{ are the velocity components of light in the rest frame,} \quad (u'_x, u'_y) \text{ are the velocity components of light in the moving frame,} \quad c^2 = u_x^2 + u_y^2.
$$

$$
\tan \phi = \frac{c \sin \theta}{{\gamma (c \cos \theta + v)}} = \frac{\sin \theta}{{\gamma \left(\frac{v}{c} + \cos \theta\right)}}
$$

$$
\tan \phi = \frac{c \sin 90^\circ}{{1 (c \cos 90^\circ + v)}} = \frac{\sin 90^\circ}{{1 \left(\frac{v}{c} + \cos 90^\circ\right)}}
$$

$$
\tan(\theta - \phi) = \cot \phi = \gamma \left(\frac{v}{c} + \cos \theta\right) \sin \theta = \frac{v}{c}
$$

$$
\theta - \phi \text{ is very small, so aberration } \alpha \approx \frac{v}{c}
$$

The annual variation of aberration can be seen in the figure above. Around the time of March equinox, the Earth is travelling toward left in this figure, so starlight is also bent toward the left, but as the Earth approaches the June solstice, the aberration vanishes and then again increases as the Earth travels toward the September equinox. The aberration again goes to zero around the time of December solstice.
