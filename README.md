In this example of 2D frame moving only in the 
x-direction, the vertical component of the apparent speed of light (u) will not change, but the horizontal component will be modified due to the velocity of the Earth.

$$
\tan \phi = \frac{{u'y}}{{u'x}} = \frac{{uy}}{{\gamma(ux + v)}}
$$

$$
\gamma = \left(1 - \frac{{v^2}}{{c^2}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}, \quad v \text{ is the velocity of the observer}, \quad c \text{ is the magnitude of the velocity of light.}
$$

$$
(u_x, u_y) \text{ are the velocity components of light in the rest frame,} \quad (u'_x, u'_y) \text{ are the velocity components of light in the moving frame,} \quad c^2 = u_x^2 + u_y^2.
$$
